3. About Page (/about.html)
Main Content
Title: "About Flexpandas"
At Flexpandas, we believe small businesses and creators shouldn't waste time on work that software can do for them.
We started as a small remote team helping brands with design projects — logos, websites, social media graphics. Over time, we noticed the same pattern: clients were drowning in repetitive tasks, struggling to keep up with leads, and spending more time managing tools than serving customers.
So we expanded. Today, Flexpandas helps businesses save time and scale faster with:

Automation & AI — systems that capture leads, follow up automatically, and run your business on autopilot
Design Subscriptions — on-demand creative, without the cost of an in-house team
Video Editing Subscriptions — consistent, branded content that keeps you visible everywhere

Our team is small, flexible, and global — with automation experts, designers, and editors ready to plug in as your on-demand operations partner.
Why the name Flexpandas?
Because we're flexible like bamboo — and as reliable as a panda who always shows up.
